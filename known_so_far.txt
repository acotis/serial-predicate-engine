Stopping-point arities
----------------------

From toaq.org, we have:

  "For some predicate words, the difference between different
   arities is very minor, as when lower arity versions simply
   lack later argument places of the higher arity versions"

Yet in *dua mai*, using the 1-ary definition of *dua* would yield
*dua ru mai* as the expansion, which certainly isn't useful.

So, define a "stopping point arity" as an arity of a word where
either (1) no more arguments can be added or (2) adding more
arguments changes the type of previous arguments.  So:

  . *jeo-1* [0] is a SPA, since *jeo-2* is [c 1].
  . *jeo-2* [c 1] is a SPA, since there is no *jeo-3*.
  . *dua-1* [c] is not, since *dua-2* is [c 0] = *dua-1* + [0]

During composition, only stopping-point arities are permissible
candidicates for predicate expansion.  So, jeo has both [0] and
[c 1], but dua has only [c 0].


Slots with type "c or 0"
-------------------------

Some slots seem to have type "c or 0".  For example, the
signature of "hui" seems like it must be [(c), (0)], since both
objects and propositions can be bad.  So, what does *hui mai*
expand to?  Is it *hui ru mai* or *hui (mai)*?

From toaq.org: "each...word is really a family of...predicates."

Predicates:
     *jeo* = ___(0) is true
     *jeo* = ___(c) exhibits property ___(1)
     *mai* = ___(c) loves ___(c)

Words:
    *jeo* = ___(0) is true; ___(c) exhibits property ___(1)
    *mai* = ___(c) loves somebody; ___(c) loves ___(c)

Extracting only the values in parens from a predicate
yields the TYPELIST of the PREDICATE.

Doing so for each predicate in a word
yields the SIGNATURE of the WORD.

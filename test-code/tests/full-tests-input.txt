// [14 Aug 2018]  I've just discovered that serial predicates containing members of RU might combine differently
// than I thought.  I'm going to wait to figure that out before continuing here.  Meanwhile I'll work on other aspects
// of the program.  

// [19 Aug 2018, EM]  One useful test to have around would be the "is-subset" comparison: for two predicates, P and Q,
// with arity(Q) = q and arity(P) = p > q, plug in only q arguments into P, using "" for the rest.  See if the result
// equals the result when q arguments are plugged into Q.

// [19 Aug 2018]  Ooh, yikes.  "Sỉai" = `Nothing has property ___ (1)` and can produce 0-ary predicates.

// [20 Aug 2018]  I'm going to change the expected output to only put parens around "runs" of the same type of connector.
// So for example, "dua leo ru buaq ru kuai bai" parenthesizes as "dua (leo ru buaq ru kuai) bai" (outer-level parens are
// skipped).  "mu" also produces parens.  Non-trivial head-predicates should also have parens around them.


// Composition

:test dua mai		// Type (0) slot
:test leo pai		// Type (1) slot
:test poq kea		// (Combines with a "ru")
:test soq jia		// Filled slot is not at the end
:test soq jeo		// Filling word has multiple valid arities
:test tua jeaq jai	// Three-part composite
:test cheo jeo		// Filling word has multiple valid arities, and only one works
:test mia ti		// Type (2) slot
:test cua meo		// Two different abstraction slots
:test dui bu		// Two different abstraction slots, and filled by predicate with mutliple arities

// Ru

:test pai ru mai	// Simple ru
:test poq ra maomao dua	// Ru over something else
:test jeo re pu ro jia	// Two ru's
:test dua jia ru pu   	// Tests that the ru subjuncts under the dua (which it should only do in my proposed parse)
:test dua pai ri mai	// Parses WAY differently under the two models

// Ru ?-types

:test fa ru soq		// Produce a ?-type
:test bu ra jeo		// Produces ?-types if arities of predicates differ
:test bu ra jeo de	// How should ?-types be treated during composition?

// Mu

:test mu dua		// Btw, how does "mu" act on predicates with <2 slots?
:test jia mu dua
:test jia ri mu dua
:test mu mai ri mu pai

// To ru

:test to ri mai to pai
:test kuai to re chuq to nuo
:test to ra jia de to pu fie

// Bug fix

:test mia leo pai	// Fix for a bug where untagged jado broke the (max-jado-tag) function
:test mia pai		// Control

// Seen in the wild

:test dua leo ru buaq bai		// Used in "Sa Búai Hủohūa"
:test bu tea ru ceo riofa tishagiq	// Used by Ilmen.  Should be skipped in nofilter b/c of how long it is.

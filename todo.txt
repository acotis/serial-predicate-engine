Commit: Make it spit out the actual different typelists for the
        different arities of the resulting predicates (may
        require minor or moderate restructuring of the code).

----------------------------------------------------------------

Feature: Establish a database of word signatures.  Add a mode
         where you can interact with that database.  When a
         composition is queried containing words it doesn't
         know, switch into that mode automatically to add them.

Feature: Make failed compositions show up as actual errors?
         (Might not be necessary.)

 Cleanup commits

Commit: Remove home-rolled (fold) and (fold-right) functions,
        replaces all usages with (reduce) and (reduce-right).

Commit: Make the PARSE stage use the XY operator to signal
        composition, rather than having no signal.

Commit: Make it spit out the actual different typelists for the
        different arities of the resulting predicates (may
        require minor or moderate restructuring of the code).

Feature: Establish a database of word signatures.  Add a mode
         where you can interact with that database.  When a
         composition is queried containing words it doesn't
         know, switch into that mode automatically to add them.

Feature: Make failed compositions show up as actual errors?
         (Might not be necessary.)

Feature: Make this run as a webservice.

 Cleanup commits

Commit: Make the PARSE stage use the XY operator to signal
        composition, rather than having no signal.

Commit: Remove the "prenex" from the expected test output file.
        In fact, go ahead and re-write test-from-file.scm while
        you're at it.  It sucks.

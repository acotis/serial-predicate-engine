Next up: Throw all old code into a folder, pull out only what is
         necessary to pass the test cases I'm writing.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Commit: Copy in the "Pretty Print" stage of the new structure.

Commit: Write code that copies tests out of full-tests.odt and
        runs them on a dummy (compose) function.

Commit: Write the (compose) function for real.  Remember that
        jado-ify should only drop in plain jado if they would
        all fall in the top level of the predicate.  Otherwise,
        a li prenex should be used (for all of them) and they
        should be numbered.

Commit: Write a bash script that automatically runs all the
        test files?

Commit: Add error-reporting to the (parse) function by having it
        return (fail [string]) if it fails to parse [string].
        The final parse should be scanned to see if it contains
        such a failure at any nesting level, and if it does, the
        error should be reported and program execution should
        halt.  Add tests and documentation for same.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Feature: Establish a database of word signatures.  Add a mode
         where you can interact with that database.  When a
         composition is queried containing words it doesn't
         know, switch into that mode automatically to add them.

Feature: Add an interactive parse REPL loop.

Commit: Refactor the codebase to match up with stages.odt.

Commit: Make it report unknown words, rather than returning
        () for them.

Commit: Make the program return to the REPL loop even if it fails
        to parse something.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Feature: Establish a database of word signatures.  Add a mode
         where you can interact with that database.  When a
         composition is queried containing words it doesn't
         know, switch into that mode automatically to add them.

Feature: Make failed compositions show up as actual errors?
         (Might not be necessary.)

 Cleanup commits

        replaces all usages with (reduce) and (reduce-right).

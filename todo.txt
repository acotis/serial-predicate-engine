Commit: Make it only print out the serialization of the full
        forms of each predicate.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Feature: Establish a database of word signatures.  Add a mode
         where you can interact with that database.  When a
         composition is queried containing words it doesn't
         know, switch into that mode automatically to add them.

Feature: Make failed compositions show up as actual errors?
         (Might not be necessary.)

        replaces all usages with (reduce) and (reduce-right).
